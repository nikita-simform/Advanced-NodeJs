In Node.js, a child process is an independent operating system process that can be spawned to run CPU - intensive, I / O - intensive, or external tasks.

Why Use Child Processes?
There are several compelling reasons to use child processes in Node.js applications:
- Concurrency: Child processes allow for concurrent task execution, optimizing system resources.
- Isolation: Child processes provide isolation, preventing failures from affecting the main app.
- Parallelism: Parallel execution can be improved with child processes, which perform multiple operations simultaneously.
